Sat Sep 27 03:16:28 UTC 2014

Multi-Router Looking Glass allows network administrators to execute 
commands on multiple routers via a nice web interface.

Changes for 5.5.0
Removed fastping.c - See CVE-2014-3931 at 
http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/cve/CVE-2014-3931.txt
Removed fping1
Replaced fping1 and fastping.c with fastping2.sh (bash shell script)

Changes for 5.4.1

Security fix to trap for Cisco crash attempts using specially crafted regexp.

Changes for 5.2.0

* Bug fix in argument parsing to allow IPv6 address notation in ping and 
traceroute queries.

* Added the ability to log remote queries. (Didn't you always want to 
know how your looking-glass was being used?)


Changes for version 5.1.1

* Updated GNU License information.

* Corrected a few spelling typos.

* Created patch files from 4.3.0 -> 5.1.1 and 5.0.0 -> 5.1.1

Changes for version 5.1.0

* Implemented Net::SSH::Perl routines to allow SSH access to routers.

* Added debug routines to code to aid in debugging config file when 
adding a new router.

* Changed code to set $login_user to 'no_login_user_defined' if 
'login_user' is not set in config file. *Change required by SSH 
routines.

* Changed code to set $login_pass to 'no_login_pass_defined' if 
'login_pass' is not set in config file. *Change required by SSH 
routines.

* Cleaned up code to allow easier modification/debugging.

* Added 'use_ssh' config parameter to config file to tell MRLG to use SSH.

* Added 'use_port' config parameter to config file to tell MRLG to use a 
specific port for all connections to a specific router.

* Added 'debug' config parameter to config file to tell MRLG to output 
debug information for a specific router.

* Added $::writable_directory config parameter to config file to tell 
MRLG where to store the known_hosts file that is created by 
Net::SSH::Perl when an SSH connection is used.


Changes for version 5.0.0

* Integrated patch supplied by Jeff Barrow to support username/password 
authentication for devices that require a username to log in.

* Upgraded code to use Net::Telnet::Cisco.

* Added a few <!-- --> tags for Google-bait so I can look and see how 
many people are running my code. ;)
  Please leave these in place.  I get a kick out of seeing all of the different networks that use this code.

* More features coming soon - IE; SSH support!


SECURITY UPDATE in version 4.3.0

Removed the ability of remote users to specify "nei" or any other 
variation of "neighbors" as an ARG to the "sh ip bgp" command.


* = NEW feature in version 4.2.1

Available commands:

  show ip bgp [ARG]
  show ip bgp summary
  show ip bgp ipv4 multicast [ARG]
  show ip bgp ipv4 multicast summary
  show ip ospf [ARG]
* show ip rip [ARG: database (on cisco)]
* show ip protocols
  show ip route [ARG]
  show interface [ARG]
  show version
  trace [ip address or FQDN]
  ping [ip address or FQDN]

* Security Option:

You can assign unique password for each router.  Users of the MRLG must 
then enter the proper password to access that router via the MRLG.

* Seperate config file: 
Version 4.2.1 implements mrlg.conf which contains all router access 
information.  This file is placed outside of your webserver root for 
higher security. ************ Many thanks to Stephane Bortzmeyer for 
modifying the MRLG to support a config file! ************


MRLG is modular.  Administrators can add or remove commands from the 
MRLG to fit their individual needs.


Tested with:

Cisco 11.1(28)CC
Zebra (0.88 and above) 
Quagga (all versions since fork from Zebra)
