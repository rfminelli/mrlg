To run the Multi-Router Looking Glass, you need to be sure you have:

- at least one IP router with interesting things to show to the world 
(or to your local network). MRLG is known to work with Cisco, Quagga, 
Zebra, and Marconi/Fore Systems routers.  You should be able to modify 
it to obtain information from any device that has a telnet console.

- a Web server with Perl and Net::Telnet::Cisco.  You can get 
Net::Telnet::Cisco from http://www.cpan.org/ Previous versions of MRLG 
used Net::Telnet so, if you're upgrading, make sure you have 
Net::Telnet::Cisco installed.  If you are going to be using SSH to 
connect to any of your routers, you'll also need Net::SSH::Perl, also 
available from CPAN.

For whatever reason, I had to make the following change in Perl.pm of 
the Net::SSH::Perl module to force it to use ports above 1024 to make 
connections.

In /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/Net/SSH/Perl.pm:

I changed:

    my $user = _current_user();
    if ($user && $user eq "root" &&
      !defined $ssh->{config}->get('privileged')) {
        $ssh->{config}->set('privileged', 1);
    }


to be:


    my $user = _current_user();
    if ($user && $user eq "root" &&
      !defined $ssh->{config}->get('privileged')) {
        $ssh->{config}->set('privileged', 0);
    }



To install the Multi-Router Looking Glass, you have to:

- copy index.cgi to a place where your Web server allows CGI.

- chmod +x index.cgi

- copy mrlg.conf.sample to /etc/mrlg.conf. Edit it to suit your needs.

- copy fastping2.sh, ztr and ztraceroute to /usr/local/bin/

- chmod +x fastping2.sh, ztr and ztraceroute

- possibly edit fastping2.sh, ztr to set the proper path to perl, bash 
and ping on your system.

- possibly edit ztraceroute to set and the address, port and password of 
the router that will be used and set the path to perl and traceroute on 
your system.

- create a directory that is writable by your webserver process. (This 
is used by Net::SSH::Perl to store the known_hosts file.)  Example:

# mkdir /var/www
# chown apache.apache /var/www



Files following files are used with MRLG:


index.cgi 	= The actual MRLG script
mrlg.conf	= The config file for MRLG
fastping2.sh	= bash script that emulates Cisco PING output and provides
                  fast ping execution.

ztr		 = bash script to execute ztraceroute routing errors to 
		  /dev/null This was necessary on my systems.  It may not be 
		  on yours. It doesn't hurt anything to use it.
ztraceroute	= Perl script that provides live routing information for hops 
                  in a traceroute.  This produces the same traceroute output 
                  as a Cisco.


As always, the latest version of the MRLG can be downloaded from

If you use MRLG, please let me know and preferrably, provide me a link 
to your looking-glass in an email to mrlg@op-sec.us.
